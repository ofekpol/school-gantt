## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Custom SVG/Canvas for Gantt (C1) — no off-shelf lib handles RTL + multi-grade spanning bars
- Init: CSS `@media print` for PDF (D1) — no server-side rendering needed
- Init: Polling + 5 s Cache-Control for ≤ 5 s freshness (E1)
- Init: shadcn RTL patches needed for Popover, Calendar, Dropdown — budget half-day in Phase 0

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 0: shadcn RTL patch scope unknown until components are tested in Hebrew layout
- Phase 1: Hebrew password-reset email deliverability requires SPF/DKIM/DMARC setup
- Phase 5: Gantt perf at >2k DOM nodes may require Canvas virtualization — validate early in Phase 5
